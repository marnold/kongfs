  An inital attempt at a full POSIX compliant filesystem built on a NoSQL database. Note this isn't another 
MongoDB FUSEmount project. I just borrowed GridFS datastructures for the first draft, future versions will
replace these with an INode, and journaling infesturucture of my own design. Based on Spanning Trees.
I'm not sure when I'll make it back to this resarch but, eventually the plan is to have an In kernel NoSQL 
DB, and build the FS on that. But I'm publising the prototype now, for reasons to complex to get into here.
Do Not use this in production, your disk will be eaten within one hour or less.
