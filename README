  An initial attempt at a full POSIX compliant system built on a NoSQL database. Note this isn't another 
MongoDB FUSE-mount project. I just borrowed GridFS data structures for the first draft, future versions will
replace these with an INode, and journaling infrastructure of my own design. Based on Spanning Trees.
I'm not sure when I'll make it back to this research but, eventually the plan is to have an In kernel NoSQL 
DB, and build the FS on that. But I'm publishing the prototype now, for reasons to complex to get into here.
Do Not use this in production, your disk will be eaten within one hour or less.
